_Modern Day Applications of Defending High-Priority Structures in a Fantasy Environment: A Tower Defense_

## Purpose

We built this application in our Processes of Object-Oriented Development class in fall 2013. Our task only required that we create a tower defense game with no other specifics. So how far could we go? The project fuses some role-playing and real time strategy elements into the tower defense without trying to overwhelm the player.
